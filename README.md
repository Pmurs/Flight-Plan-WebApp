# Flight-Plan-WebApp

This is the Flight Plan Management Web Application that I created for my Web Programming course at Vanderbilt.

It allows you to create a user account and register flight plans for private planes. The application is built on a Node.js server.

On the server side, it uses AJAX for server calls, Mongoose and MongoDB for data persistency and REDIS for cacheing.
On the client side, it uses Javascript, HTML, CSS and Jade to build webpages. The map is rendered using Leaflet.
